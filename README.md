## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
* [x ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
* [x ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
* [x ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
- I can make the buttons less static and move them around a bit

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

I watched programming with Mosh channel on youtube;
-JavaScript Tutorial for beginners:Learn JavaScript in one hour

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   I learnt a lot as I walked through the application and it reminded me of some of the concepts I had forgotten. I spent some time trying to understand how to change buttons using Javascript and how each line of code functioned. It turned out not to be a very hard concept but it just needed a little effort on my part and I had a fun time learning.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission?

I am constantly fascinated by how html,css and javascript compliment each other especially in this project. I loved working on this project and one of the things I was curious about is other features of these languages I did not exploit in this project and how they might potentially function. I enjoyed this project because it really piqued my interest. I am also eager to understand how to develop a full working website using these languages and it was one of my biggest ambitions when i started out as a self-taught programmer.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I would definitely add more audio features to the game. This seemed like of those games children play and they are usually more fun for consumers when you add customized sounds that appeal to them. I would also move around the buttons a bit and add movements everytime someone presses it.
